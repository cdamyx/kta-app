# kta-app

My original submission for this app is still captured under the 'main' branch. The more complete app is under branch 'full-app'.

This is a simple Single Page Application built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and VueJS.

To view this app in your local browser, please clone this repo to your local machine, and install Vue (Vite) with these instructions (note - you'll need to install npm first, if you don't already have it): https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue 

Afterwards, you should be able to run `npm run dev` from the local repo root and then navigate to http://localhost:5173 in your browser.
